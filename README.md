In this project, I developed an application that makes `automatic dubbing` dusing `python`. Although it is not a high-level application, you can successfully get the results you want if you extract the sounds and `listen` to the application.

### Let's set the requirements

> Let's install the ``translate`` package
> ``` bash
> $ pyton3.10 -m pip install translate
> ```

> In the ``gtts`` package
> ``` bash
> $ pyton3.10 -m pip install gtts
> ```

> In the ``SpeechRecognition`` package
> ``` bash
> $ pyton3.10 -m pip install SpeechRecognition
> ```

----

### Run the application
Now all that remains is to run our application.

> In the ``SpeechRecognition`` package
> ``` bash
> $ pyton3.10 main.py
> ```
